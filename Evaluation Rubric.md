- **Score 7 (Highly Scalable):** Minimal switching costs/financial barriers and exceptionally transparent circularity performance data.

**5.2 Technological and Scientific Scalability**
- **Score 1 (Not Scalable):** Limits adoption and has negative impacts approaching thermodynamic limits.
- **Score 3 (Moderately Scalable):** Allows partial adoption with some limitations and challenges.
- **Score 5 (Scalable):** Allows broad adoption without significant limitations.
- **Score 7 (Highly Scalable):** Enables widespread adoption without any negative impact on thermodynamic limits.

#### 6. Adherence to Circular Economy Principles
- **Score 1 (Low Adherence):** Fails to enhance product utilization and material efficiency, and neglects the use of recycled materials.
- **Score 3 (Moderate Adherence):** Partially adheres to circular economy principles with room for improvement.
- **Score 5 (High Adherence):** Demonstrates strong adherence to circular economy principles with increased product utilization, high material efficiency, and use of recycled materials.
- **Score 7 (Exceptional Adherence):** Exemplifies exceptional adherence to circular economy principles, maximizing product utilization, ensuring high material efficiency, and incorporating a substantial amount of recycled materials.

This rubric aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of circular economy business ideas based on various critical criteria.
